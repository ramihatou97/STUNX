# 🚨 Railway Emergency Fix - Root Directory Error

## Problem
Railway error: "Could not find root directory: [filename]"
Railway is treating the filename AS the directory instead of looking IN the directory.

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Method 1: Dashboard Fix (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app
2. **Open your project**
3. **Click Settings** (gear icon)
4. **Find "Source" section**
5. **Find "Root Directory" field**

**CRITICAL STEP:**
- **DELETE ALL TEXT** from Root Directory field
- Leave it **COMPLETELY EMPTY**
- Click **Save**

6. **Go to Deployments tab**
7. **Click "Deploy Latest"**

### Method 2: CLI Override (BACKUP)
```bash
# In your project directory
cd /c/Users/ramih/koo-platform-complete

# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**What's happening:**
```
❌ Railway thinks: Root Directory = "nixpacks.toml"
❌ Railway looks for: /nixpacks.toml/nixpacks.toml

✅ Should be: Root Directory = "" (empty)
✅ Railway should find: /nixpacks.toml
```

## 📋 Verification Steps

After fixing:
1. **Check deployment logs** for:
   - ✅ "Found nixpacks.toml"
   - ✅ "Building from repository root"
   - ✅ No "Could not find" errors

2. **Verify file detection:**
   - ✅ nixpacks.toml found
   - ✅ backend/requirements.txt found
   - ✅ backend/main.py found

## 🆘 Last Resort Options

### Option A: Reset GitHub Connection
1. **Disconnect** GitHub repo from Railway
2. **Reconnect** and let Railway auto-detect
3. **Don't set custom Root Directory**

### Option B: Create New Railway Project
1. **Create new Railway project**
2. **Connect same GitHub repo**
3. **Let Railway auto-detect everything**

### Option C: Manual File Deployment
1. **Use Railway CLI** exclusively
2. **Bypass web dashboard issues**

## ✅ Success Indicators

Deployment should show:
```
✅ Found nixpacks.toml
✅ Installing Python dependencies
✅ cd backend && python main.py
✅ Health check passed: /health
```
